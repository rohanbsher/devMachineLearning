Machine Learning: 

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 

Supervised 
-- Feeding data labeled as Given input x results in output y our algorithm learns the relation
-- predicts results based on large data fed into the algorithm.
-- learn based on right answers

 -- classical ( labeled data (any categories) is analyzed and the algorithm learns to predict categories based on input)
 -- regression (predict a specific number based on data like house prices)
 
 -- example : spam filtering (provide algorithm emails labeled as spam or not)
            : speech recognition (given audio provide a transcript)
            : online advertising
            : machine translation
            : visual inspection
            
  
 
Unsupervised
-- Discover new patterns using deep learning 
-- example google news - given news articles everyday create models to synthesize the news articles and identify hidden patterns
-- clustering (group similar data together) creating categories based on interesting relations.
-- anomaly detection : find unusual data points (fraud detection)
-- dimensionality reduction : compress data using fewer numbers
