Machine Learning: 

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 

Supervised 
-- Feeding data labeled as Given input x results in output y our algorithm learns the relation
-- predicts results based on large data fed into the algorithm.
-- learn based on right answers

 -- classical ( labeled data (any categories) is analyzed and the algorithm learns to predict categories based on input)
 -- regression (predict a specific number based on data like house prices)
 
 -- example : spam filtering (provide algorithm emails labeled as spam or not)
            : speech recognition (given audio provide a transcript)
            : online advertising
            : machine translation
            : visual inspection
            
  
 
Unsupervised
-- Discover new patterns using deep learning 
-- example google news - given news articles everyday create models to synthesize the news articles and identify hidden patterns
-- clustering (group similar data together) creating categories based on interesting relations.
-- anomaly detection : find unusual data points (fraud detection)
-- dimensionality reduction : compress data using fewer numbers

Linear Regression: 

— f(x) = ax + b 
— The linear relationship between two variables can be drawn as a straight line graph and the gradient of the line calculates the rate of change between the two variables.


Regression models using cost function 

Gradient discent algorithm : used in deep learning model (advance neural network)
-- its basically an algorithm that helps minimize the function.
-- recalibrates the values such that the desired outcome or less errors are achieved


Multiple features (Multiple regression model) : 
-- when there are multiple features on a given dataset this model can provide accurate predictions using vectorization


Logistic Regression
-- Sigmoid (Logistic function)
-- g = 1 / (1 + e^-z)
